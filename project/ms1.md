# MILESTONE ONE

## GAME DESCRIPTION

> ### BASE IDEA

The idea for this game is a multiplayer version of snake. The game will be a point based competition to see how many times a player can pick up the food without running into themselves, other players, or other obstacles. Levels will be point based and a minimum number of points must be collected before moving onto the next level. A leaderboard will be created tp represent the top scores.

> ### LOGGING IN
 
When the game is first accessed users will be asked to login, if a user account does not already exist for the user they may choose to create a new one. If the user attempts a login but it fails, then an error will appear asking them to check their username, password, or to create a new user.

> ### GAME LOBBY

Once the user is logged in they will be directed to a game lobby. The game lobby will host the levels and games currently available to them. A list of other users currently online will be visible as well. The user will have the choice to either join a current game or create a new one.

> ### GAMEPLAY

When the user enters gameplay they will be presented with a game screen that consists of current players, their scores, and other players snake character. Other players snakes will appear as a different color than their own and appear with a slight opacity to help distinguish them. Small collectible 'food' items will appear randomly on the board and when collected by a player will add a specific value to the players current score. Game levels will be distinguished by total points needed to complete, and the final level will be an  endless game that continues as long as the player doesn't collide with themself or with other players

> ### TWO PLAYER GAMES

Two player games will involve any two players competing in the same level for the points required to finish the level. When one of the players reaches the required score the game will end, and the player that reached the required score will continue to the next level while the losing player must restart the level. 

> ### OBJECTIVE AND SCORING
 
The objective of the game is simple, collect the food items to receive the points required to complete a level. Most levels will have a standard number of points assigned to a single food item. A special section of duel games will also be created with options to assign random values to food items and determine the score needed to complete the level.

> ### ADMINISTRATORS

A small group of users will be given administration rights and access to admin controls for games, users, and database related operations.

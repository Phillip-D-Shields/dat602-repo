### ms1 aftermath

i reviewed my ms1 submission. i am pretty sure its terrible. I am going to realign and do something else, maybe something decentralized. 

Class talked about joins. I remember doing a few in DAT5. Classes are mostly code snippets and high-level conversations about aspects of MySql that I find nearly impossible to understand. I still have no idea how or why to do the expected tasks.

I am pretty sure I can create a nifty game using a blockchain stack that could use IPFS as a replacement for most of the relational database stuff, and the ethereum network for user specific activity. I don't know what else to do, so I will look into that.

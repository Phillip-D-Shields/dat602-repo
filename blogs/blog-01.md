### diagrams and sql

This week we covered the diagrams for the planning stages of our upcoming assessment and some fundamental sql commands. 

The basic structure and rules for ERDs are pretty easy for me to understand and comprehend, the same goes for most sql commands. I struggled to follow some of the course material in class, because I wasn't able to digest or utilize some info before then next topic was started. I found it very difficult to understand some the ERD connections and relationships when most of the ERD was completed in such a short amount of time.

I personally think that its important for me to read those diagrams, more than to be able to write them. Whenever I need to write them, I just use reliable sources of information or official docs. This same line of thought goes for sql, i can read it and understand it fairly well now, but couldnt correctly write it without referencing official docs. Since I won't go into a database related field, i think being able to just read is sufficient for me.

I have found some outside tutorials that have been useful for me to practice and learn more about C#. I made a virtal zoo in the console, and a memory game using forms.

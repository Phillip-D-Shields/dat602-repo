### Blog Zero

This week we have covered the class assessments and other class requirements.

We will be focusing on mySQL and C# this semester, both of which I have some limited exposure to. I previously played with SQL for a decent amount of time, so I think that will be easy for me to pick back up. C# and I have a rough past, hoping to make up ground with that this semester.

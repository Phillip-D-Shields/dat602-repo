### milestone two

I have realigned this project again. I feel like a child wondering around aimlessly. The classes and class content are completely lost on me. I feel stupid sitting there pretending like I know what is going on. It feels humiliating in a way.

I started preparing MS2 with my new decentralized direction. I am rather excited and will try to meet the same requirements, or challenge them if I can't meet them directly. I want to complete something for this class. I can't afford to fail.

### mySQL

We have been going over milestone one requirements and SQL in class. I get most of it.

I have been having great difficulty following the way most classes are taught here. not sure if it is a New Zealand thing, or an NMIT thing. But the approach of defining new concepts and then trying to apply them doesnt help me understand much, and in most ways it confuses me. I often have to take a complete project, define the major activity occuring, then inspect the code happening with those activity sections. Learning within predefined context is the most beneficial approach for me. 

For example, I have started a multiplayer snake tutorial using javascript. First, I complete the whole tutorial focusing on the major activities occuring (here the backend communicates with the frontend, here the game state is initialized, here the game state is updated, here is where the login checks with the db, etc...). Second, I then investigate those sections individually, breaking them into subsections (so to init the game i need to do A, then B, and then C and D together), I usually begin to understand much more about the code when I enter these subsections, especially when I need to break them into smaller chunks. I start adding comments at this point, helping to cement what the code is actually doing. For me, this big to little approach works well and I have been able to learn a lot this way. It is also the best way I know to understand the project enough to begin creating ERDs. 

Here at NMIT, in most of the classes, the opposite approach is taken and things are built from little to big. Which I think for most people is fine, and I don't think most students struggle the same way I do. But my inability to get past this approach has destroyed my confidence and become more of an obstacle to learning for me.

I have done multiple c# tutorials outside of class, and picked up bits and pieces. But I have found it very frustrating that I have been required to take classes that use C# for high level projects, before I have taken the intro to C# course.

I will continue on with making this class assessment with javascript, it is the only way I feel i can succeed, complete the milestones / assessments, and learn more about the process.

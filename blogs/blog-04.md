### ms1 completely off the rails 

I submitted MS1 with the javascript snake game. I don't think it was adequate. I just need to pass.

this class is not about learning anymore. I am just trying to survive. Everytime I try to open mysql workbench I become deeply depressed and anxious, even when trying to incorporate my current js snake game with mysql. Not sure what to do.

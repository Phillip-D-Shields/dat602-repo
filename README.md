# Phillip Shields DAT602 Blogs Repo

This repo contains two main directories. One for blogs, and the other for the class assessment project.

I have enabled discussions on this repo, just click on the Discussions tab above. I created two sections for discussion, one for ideas and another specifically for questions that you would like answered.

check out the [initial discussion post here](https://github.com/Phillip-D-Shields/dat602-repo/discussions)
